## Developer guide

## Installation

To use this program you will have to install modified NSGA-III library pymoo (Deb et al.):

    git clone -b artemii_edits https://github.com/Electr0phile/pymoo/
    cd pymoo
    pip install .

Additionally you will also need to install NumPy:

    pip install numpy

After that run Evaluation2.py:

    python Evaluation2.py
    
After execution it will save images with resulting plots to \*.png files.
